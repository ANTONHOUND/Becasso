IMPORTANT NOTICE
============

Note that to unlock Becasso, you will need a Keyfile.  Such a Keyfile can be purchased
at BeBits.  Without such a Keyfile, Becasso will function in "trial" or "demo" mode.  You will be able to use all functionality, but

• Exported and printed images will have the text 
   "Becasso" printed diagonally across the image
• Images saved in Becasso's native file format
   will have an "invisible" watermark, which only
   becomes visible when loading the files in other
   applications.  These native files can later be
   loaded and saved again with a registered version
   of Becasso to remove the watermark.
