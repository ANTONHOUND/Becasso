Becasso 1.4 Release Notes

Below is a list of features new in version 1.4.

Also included in this distribution are PNG, JPEG, GIF, EPS, and Becasso Translators.  Note that most of these use shared libraries and will only function from within other applications when these are in the correct place (~/config/lib).  The BeOS comes with JPEG and PNG translators, but these don't use shared libraries, and offer less adjustable parameters.  The GIF Translator is read/write but due to licensing issues, it only writes out uncompressed GIF files.  It is compatible with GIF89a transparency extensions though.  More information about the GIF compression can be found in the documentation to it (accessible via the Preferences/Datatranslations application).
The EPS Translator is output-only (and outputs EPS bitmaps) unless Ghostscript is installed and libgs.so is in ~/config/lib, in which case it will detect this and allow reading of PS files (!).
A BeOS port of Ghostscript can be found at <http://home.beoscentral.com/jehamby/>.
Wacom Tablet support has now been moved to a separate input_server add-on which can be installed optionally.  This driver is very rudymentary and can be configured via the "Tablet" preferences app included with Becasso.
