Black/White-to-Color Gradient</font></b><p>

<font face="Swiss, Helvetica, Sans-serif">
This tutorial shows how to use the powerful Selection-to-Channel
operations Becasso 1.1 offers, to yield an image that has a
black-and-white background but with a smooth transition to a colorful
region.<P>

Note that this is an old tutorial, and the same effect can be achieved
<i>much</i> easier now in Becasso 1.5 using the DuoTone add-on and a graded selection map.
The tutorial is retained here for reference, and because it explains about
pixel intensities and the "multiply" channel operation.<p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<img src="image1.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4">
Let's open a colorful image in Becasso.  The sports car used in
this example is mainly red.  Simply replacing the <i>saturation</i>
channel of the image with a gradient would throw away any saturation 
information already there, so we will first save this information by 
choosing <b>Edit &gt; Channel to Selection &gt; Saturation</b>.  This 
copies the saturation channel into the selection map.

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<img src="image2.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4">
Now, we add a second layer to the image.  We want to 'extract' the 
selected saturation information into a channel of the newly created layer.
Let's take the green channel as this is nice and contrasty.  Selecting 
<b>Edit &gt; Selection to Channel &gt; Green</b> yields no visible
result however, since the alpha channel of the new layer is still zero
everywhere (i.e. the image is there, only completely transparent).
To visualize what we are doing, do an <b>Edit &gt; Select All</b>
(<code>Alt-A</code>) and an <b>Edit &gt; Selection to Channel &gt;
Alpha</b> to make the layer fully opaque.  There's our saturation
channel!
<br clear="all"><br><br>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<img src="layers.gif" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4">
Now, we add a third layer containing our actual gradient, using the
Gradient Generator add-on.
In this case, 'white' will correspond to maximum color later, and
'black' to 'black-and-white'.<p>

We will now have to 'combine' the gradient and the original saturation
information.  This is simply done by setting the gradient layer channel
operation to 'Multiply', and merging the top two layers.  This works
because multiplying with black yields zero, and multiplying with white
yields the original information.<p>

This results in a combined gradient ranging from the full original 
saturation information in the top left, to no saturation outwards.
<br clear="all"><br><br>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<img src="image3.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4">
We will now copy this combined saturation information over the old
saturation channel of the original image.  To do this, we use <b>Edit
&gt; Channel to Selection &gt; Green</b>.  The selection map will 
then contain a simple copy of the saturation information in the layer 
we used as a 'scratch pad' for our multiplication.<p>

Now we select the layer containing the original image.  Selecting <b>Edit
&gt; Selection to Channel &gt; Saturation</b> replaces the original
saturation information with our new gradiented version, yielding the
desired result.
