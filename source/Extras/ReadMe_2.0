Translators

Becasso comes with a set of Translators.  The installer will not overwrite any
existing Translators (with the exception of the Becasso native Translator), even
if these were installed along with a previous version of Becasso.  Instead, the 
installer will ask you whether the current Translator may be replaced.  In most 
cases, it should be safe to click the "Yes" button.  Only if you have installed a
third party Translator (such as a GIF Translator) which you want to keep and
use instead of Becasso's, you can skip installing that particular Translator.


Trial version - important notice

Note that to unlock Becasso, you will need a Keyfile.  Such a Keyfile can be purchased
online.  Without such a Keyfile, Becasso will function in "trial" or "demo" mode.  You will be able to use all functionality, but

• Exported and printed images will have the text 
   "Becasso" printed diagonally across the image
• Images saved in Becasso's native file format
   will have an "invisible" watermark, which only
   becomes visible when loading the files in other
   applications.  These native files can later be
   loaded and saved again with a registered version
   of Becasso to remove the watermark.
