<h1>GIF Compression</h1>

The Graphics Interchange Format&copy; is a format for image files.  Although better formats are
available, GIF<sup>sm</sup> is still the <i>de facto</i> standard for many web graphics.  It actually
does a good job for graphics like (small) buttons and panels.  For images of photographic nature, the JPEG
format is better suited.  The reason for this distinction is that the JPEG format uses a so-called 
<i>lossy compression scheme</i>, which means that an image compressed with JPEG does not hold
all details of the original image.  Depending on the quality setting (which is adjustable), a trade-off can be
made between compactness of the resulting file and faithfulness to the original.  Due to the nature of the
compression algorithm, JPEG is not particularly good at compressing graphics of "artificial" origin containing
text, sharp edges, line art, etc., such as web buttons or business graphics.<p>
The GIF format, on the contrary, offers <i>lossless compression</i>.  Due to its algorithm, GIF is best at
compressing areas of (exactly) the same color (which hardly ever occur in photographic images).  A drawback
of the GIF format is that it is limited to a palette of 256 colors.  To achieve better-looking results, you
can use a technique called <i>dithering</i>, in which the inability of the human eye to exactly resolve
adjacent pixels is taken advantage of to create the illusion of mixed colors (for example using 
Becasso's <b>Quantize</b> add-on).  For even better results, the palette used for the
quantization can be matched to best represent the colors used in the image by using Becasso's <b>Edit &gt; Extract
Palette...</b> option.

<h1>The Unisys Patent</h1>

Unfortunately, the algorithm used for compression in GIF files (the so-called LZW algorithm) is covered
by a patent held by Unisys.  This means distributing software that uses this algorithm is charged on a per-copy
basis.<p>
Because of this, the GIF Translator by Sum Software avoids the use of the LZW algorithm,
exploiting a feature of the GIF format that allows exporting <i>uncompressed</i> files.  This way,
the GIF Translator can be kept free.  The drawback, obviously, is larger files, which can be a rather
important factor for web graphics.

<h1>Third Party Compression Services</h1>

Since the patent only covers the software using the algorithm and not the resulting image files
themselves, nothing prevents you from loading the uncompressed GIF files into a commercial
application that <i>does</i> license the algoritm, and writing them out again as compressed GIFs.<p>
An interesting opportunity to compress your GIF files is the online compression service of
<a href="http://www.gifwizard.com/pn=43051">GIF Wizard</a>.  You can specify a web site for them
to check and recompress all GIF (and JPEG) files on it, or have them compress single files.

Since the BeOS comes with a simple web server, called PoorMan, it is quite easy to use GIF Wizard:
<ul>
<li>Open PoorMan (it's in the Applications menu).  If it is launched for the first time, you can specify
the directory containing the images you want to compress, or have it create the default directory.
<li>Put your image files in the correct directory (the default directory for PoorMan is 
<code>/boot/home/public_html</code>) or create links to your images in that directory.
<li>Fill in your computer name or your IP address in the <code>http://</code> field in the banner above
(for Dialup users, you can find your IP address in the Dialup Networking preferences panel or the Dialup
Networking statistics panel).
<li>Click the Go! button.
<li>You will be taken to the GIF Wizard web site; further instructions can be found there.
</ul>
