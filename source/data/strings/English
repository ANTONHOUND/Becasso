135:Help
136:OK
137:The file '%s' is of type '%s'.\nThis does look like an image format to me.\nMaybe you haven't installed the corresponding Translator?
138:The file '%s' is of type '%s'.\nI don't think this is an image at all.
# 140 or 141 go at the first %s in 139, #142 or #143 at the last.
139:%s the image '%s' uses alpha as transparency instead of opacity.\n%s inverting the alpha channel.
140:I'm pretty sure
141:I suspect
# Note the trailing space on the next two strings
142:If you're seeing only a checkered pattern,\nI suggest 
143:Either that, or this image has an awful lot of transparent pixels.  If it looks strange, try

# MIME help text
150:Excuse me for interrupting.  I was trying to suggest an appropriate extension for this file, yet couldn't find any in your MIME database for '%s'.\nYou can add these extensions yourself with the FileTypes preferences application, or I would be happy to fill in my suggestions.  You can also simply forget about the outdated concept of extensions alltogether, although many other operating systems still rely on them for file identification.
151:File Type
152:Update MIME
153:Don't Patronize Me
154:I have a list of common image file types and their extension but you might have some exotic types I don't know about.  In that case, I will try to make an educated guess, and if I can't think of anything, I'll simply skip that type.  I will also stay away from file types that do have any extensions set.\nYou can always manually change my suggestions using the FileTypes preferences application.
155:Writing Image…
156:This is a rare error.  Something went wrong inside the Translator.\nIt could range from shared library conflicts to running out of hard disk space.
157:Extract Palette
158:Saving is disabled in this demo version of Becasso.\nOn http://www.sumware.demon.nl you can find information on obtaining the full version.\n\nThanks for your interest in Becasso!

# Tip of the Day

500:Tip of the day
501:Show tips at startup
502:Next tip
503:Welcome to Becasso!\nThis window will show you useful tips at startup,\nand it's recommended to read the tips at least once.
504:Have you read the documentation? :-)\nIt's available via About Becasso.
505:Right-clicking on a tool button opens its attributes (settings) window.
506:Right-clicking on a colour button opens an extensive colour editor.
507:The cursor shows you what mode you are in (a thin cross for drawing mode, a hollow cross for selection mode).
508:You can tear off the menus from Becasso's main window.  Click on their buttons, then drag the mouse.  Becasso will remember their positions.
509:Selections are not masks.  You can draw outside selections.
510:Selections are not binary.  A pixel can be "a little" selected.  In 256 grades from "not selected at all" to "fully selected", in fact.
511:To quickly grasp the concept of Becasso's selections, open a colourful image, paint a selection with the brush, and Shift-drag to copy/paste it.  You should see it's "fuzzy".
512:Where it makes sense, add-ons can operate on the selected area as well as on the selection map itself (depending on the mode).  You can make gradiented selection maps this way.
513:Use the Tab key to quickly switch between drawing mode and selection mode.
514:In selection mode, the Fill tool is equivalent to a Magic Wand.
515:The selection, by default, is inverted only when the mouse is over the canvas.  This behavior can be changed via the Preferences.
516:Becasso can be used as an external editor from within other applications (such as Gobe Productive).
517:If you have a fast machine, you can enlarge the filter preview area via the Preferences.
518:Holding down the Option key turns your cursor into a colour picker.
519:For most tools, painting with the right mouse button exchanges the foreground and background colours.
520:While a filter is open, you can drag the preview area by holding down the Command (Alt) key.
521:The arrow keys move the cursor by one pixel.  Hold the Control key for faster movement.
522:Holding both the Shift and Option keys turns the cursor into a grabbing hand.  You can then drag the canvas to scroll.
523:The "WinGrab" capture add-on is ideal for writing software documentation.  It lets you screen-grab a single window.
524:The "VideoGrabber" capture add-on in combination with a handycam is ideal for trying how a moustache would look on you.
525:Becasso is scriptable.  It can be used, for example, to convert a bunch of images to a different format.
526:Becasso comes with a Translator for its own format, so you can exchange Becasso images with other BeOS users even if they don't have the full version.
527:A bit of history trivia: Becasso was the first commercially available paint program for the BeOS.
528:When exporting to a low-fidelity file format (such as GIF), extracting the optimal colour palette followed by quantizing can increase image quality immensely (see documentation for examples).
529:Anyone can write Becasso add-ons!  The API and example code are included.
530:The colour picker works in the Magnify window too.
531:Becasso comes with web-safe colour palettes, which you can load via the Colour Editor.  (Or you can drop them on the colour buttons).
532:The colour editor accepts colour drops from other applications, and can generate them too (drag off the colour patches in the lower left corner).
533:When dropping a colour in an editor, the HTML hex representation of the colour will be pasted.
534:The BeOS desktop also accepts colour drops.
535:A colour drop on a canvas will act as a Fill.
536:The "Center Mouse" command (Command-M) is handy for drawing, say, concentric circles.
