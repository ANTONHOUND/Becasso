Add-on and Translator update pack for Becasso 1.5

29 January 2001

This is an update pack containing updated add-ons for Becasso 1.5 as well as two new ones ("WinGrab" and "VideoGrabber"), four updated Translators (for BMP, EPS, JPEG, and PNG), and updated language files for Becasso, including a new Italian translation by Guido Soranzio.


Installation instructions

• Unzip the included update.zip file into your Becasso/data directory 
   (this will automatically put the new Italian strings in the correct place).
• Double-click install.sh
   This will install the correct add-ons (depending on your CPU type, it will install 
   add-ons optimized for Pentium or PentiumPro class CPU's)

For the Translators:

• Open the Translators directory
• Drag the Translators onto the "drag Translators here" link, which will place them in
   /boot/home/config/add-ons/Translators.


Release notes

• The JPEG Translator should now work with Gobe Productive again
• The PNG Translator has "progressive decoding" fixed, and another bug which
   would sometimes hang NetPositive
• The BMP Translator has a bug fixed in decoding 8 bit images
• The EPS Translator now has options for anti-aliasing, when it detects
    Ghostscript 6.50 (http://www.bebits.com/app/1765) and Michael Pfeiffer's
    anti-aliasing BeOS drivers.  It supports 2x2 and 4x4 resampling, as well as a nifty
    mode to only anti-alias text and not graphics.

• Various bug fixes in Becasso add-ons, most notably OilPaint and ColorCurves
• New WinGrab add-on which allows you to capture a single window screen shot
   (great for making documentation for an application!)
• New VideoGrabber add-ons which captures single frames from the standard
   video input (as long as it's sending out raw video, i.e. Bt848 cards should be
   supported, but DV over Firewire isn't (yet)).
