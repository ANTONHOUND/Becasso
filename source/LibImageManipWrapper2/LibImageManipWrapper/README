LibImageManip Wrapper 0.4 for Becasso 1.5

4/6/2001

ImageManip Wrapper for Becasso provides two add-ons for Becasso. 
A filter add-on that allows to use LibImageManip manipulator add-ons and 
a transformer add-on that allows to use LibImageManip converter add-ons.

News
- PowerPC version built. Addons for Intel are in directory x86 and
  for PowerPC in directory ppc.
- LibImageManip converter add-ons work now.
- Most filters take the selection rectangle into account. 
  E.g. the "Page Curl" filter draws the page curl at the right
  bottom of the selection and not in the right corner of the
  layer (as it was done before and it is still done when no 
  selection has been made).

Bugs
The filter "Carpet" crashes Becasso when selected!

Requirements
Becasso http://www.bebits.com/app/74
LibImageManip http://www.bebits.com/app/782
ImageManip GIMP Filters http://www.bebits.com/app/1988

Installation
If Becasso is installed in /boot/apps/Becasso simply move the
files WrapperConverter and WrapperManipulator to 
"move add-ons here". If Becasso is installed elsewhere move
these two files into the "add-ons" directory in the Becasso
directory.

Have fun!
