<h1>The <i>Becasso</i> Scripting API</h1>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<a name="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

This document describes the API for scripting
<i>Becasso</i>, <i>Sum Software</i>'s Paint and Imaging
application for the BeOS.<p>

Like all well-behaved BeOS applications, <i>Becasso</i> implements scripting 
in the form of a set of messages.  The examples in this document use
Attila Mezei's freely avaiable scripting application called
<code>hey</code>, version 1.2 or greater.  <code>Hey</code> is
available from <a href="http://w3.datanet.hu/~amezei">Attila's web
site</a>.

<a name="General"><h2>Scripting General Settings</h2>

The five buttons visible in <i>Becasso</i>'s main window show the
various features of the settings <i>Becasso</i> is currently using.
They show the <i>mode</i>, <i>tool</i>, <i>foreground color</i>,
<i>background color</i>, and <i>pattern</i>, respectively.  The first
four of these can be scripted.<p>

The four scriptable properties can be both set and queried:
<font color="blue">
<pre>    hey Becasso get Mode
</pre></font>
returns the current mode (either <code>Draw</code> or
<code>Select</code>) as property named <code>result</code>.
The <code>Mode</code> and <code>Tool</code> properties can be set
either by index or by name.<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="red"><b>Note:</b></font>
When the sender of the scripting message is waiting for a reply (as
<code>hey</code> does), <i>Becasso</i> will only send a reply message.
If it isn't, <i>Becasso</i> will print the reply as a readable string
to <code>stderr</code> on the terminal it was launched from.
</blockquote>

The possible names of the <code>Mode</code> property are
<code>Draw</code> and <code>Select</code>; the <code>Tool</code> can
be either <code>Brush</code>, <code>Eraser</code>, <code>Fill</code>,
<code>Text</code>, <code>Spray Can</code>, <code>Freehand</code>,
<code>Lines</code>, <code>Free Shape</code>, <code>Polygons</code>,
<code>Rectangles</code>, <code>Ovals</code>, <code>Circles</code>, or
<code>Ellipses</code>.  These names are the names displayed in the
<i>Becasso</i> main window as help text when the mouse pointer is
moved over the icons.  <i>Becasso</i> is case insensitive, so
<font color="blue">
<pre>    hey Becasso set tool to "spray can"
    hey Becasso set Tool to "Spray Can"
</pre></code>
are equivalent.<p>

The foreground and background colors are scripted through the properties
<code>Foreground</code> and <code>Background</code>, respectively.
Querying <i>Becasso</i> for the current colors always yields them as
a <code>B_RGB_COLOR_TYPE</code> entry named <code>result</code> in the
reply message.
<blockquote>
<font color="red"><b>Note:</b></font>
This is different from the <code>Mode</code> and
<code>Tool</code> properties, because these can also function as
specifiers when scripting mode or tool parameters (see 
<a href="#Parameters">Scripting Tool Parameters</a>,
below).
</blockquote>
Setting the colors, however, can be done by either specifying the
components of an <code>rgb_color</code>, or by color name, i.e.
<font color="blue">
<pre>    hey Becasso set Foreground to "rgb_color(85,107,47,255)"
    hey Becasso set Foreground to DarkOliveGreen
</pre></font>
are equivalent.<p>

The color names are matched case-insensitively and also allow for
variants with spaces, so
<font color="blue">
<pre>    hey Becasso set background to lightslategrey
    hey Becasso set Background to "Light Slate Grey"
    hey Becasso set Background to LightSlateGrey"
    hey Becasso set Background to "Light slate GREY"
</pre></font>
are equivalent.  Also, <i>Becasso</i> tries not to be pedantic about 
spelling, so <code>Grey</code> and <code>Gray</code> are considered 
equivalent.

<blockquote>
<font color="red"><b>Note:</b></font>
To find out all the names <i>Becasso</i> recognizes as colors, run
<i>Becasso</i> from a terminal with the command line switch
<code>-c</code>, i.e.
<font color="blue">
<pre>    Becasso -c
</pre></font>
and it will print out all the color names to the terminal, preceded by
the red, green, and blue components.  Note that there are 752 entries,
so the list is quite long.  The color names are the ones that are in
the file <code>rgb.txt</code> in most XWindow distributions.
