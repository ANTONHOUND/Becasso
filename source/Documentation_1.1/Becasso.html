<a name="Overview"><h1>Overview</h1></a>
<b>Becasso</b> by <i>Sum</i> is a combined paint/image editing application
featuring alpha channel support, layering, multi-level undo/redo, add-on
architecture for external filters, transformators and generators, an
orthogonal user interface, and import/export of numerous file formats
via Datatypes.<p>

<a name="Launching"><h1>Launching</h1></a>
<b>Becasso</b> can be launched by either double-clicking on its
icon, dropping one or more files of a supported type on its icon, or
double-clicking the icon of a supported file type.  You can use the
FileTypes application to select <b>Becasso</b> as the preferred handler
for any image type for which you have installed a Datatype handler.
When launched via one of the latter two methods, <b>Becasso</b> will
open the file(s) at startup.<p>

<a name="Main Window"><h1>The Main Window</h1></a>
<img src="Images/mainwindow.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="10">
One of the main characteristics of <b>Becasso</b> is a clear and simple
user interface that doesn't get in your way and only shows what you want
it to.  The main window shows a <i>File</i> menu, five square buttons, and
a short description of the button the mouse is currently over.  From left
to right, these buttons are the Mode Selector, the Tool Selector, two
Color Selectors for the foreground and background colors, respectively,
and a Pattern Selector.</td></tr></table>

<a name="The Mouse and the Main Window"><h2>The Mouse and the Main 
Window</h2></a>
When over one of the selector buttons, the left mouse button is used
to open a popup menu to select the mode, tool, color, or pattern.
Since version 1.1, the menus are so-called <i>tear-off menus</i>,
meaning they will &quot;stick&quot; to the mouse while dragging, and
can be placed anywhere on the screen.
A right mouse button click on a button opens an Attribute Window
for the corresponding selection.  For users with a one-button mouse,
a right-click can consistently be emulated in <b>Becasso</b> by holding the
Control key while clicking.  As a special shortcut, double-clicking on a
tool button also opens the corresponding attribute window.  You can have
any number of attribute windows open at any time, allowing quick access
to the ones you regularly use.<p>

<a name="The Main File Menu"><h2>The File Menu</h2></a>
The <i>New Canvas...</i> menu option opens a dialog window in which the
dimensions of the new canvas can be adjusted.  With <i>Open File...</i>,
you can open any image file for which you have the corresponding Datatype
handler installed, as well as <b>Becasso</b>'s own file format.  You can
also open files by dropping them on the main window, or by double-clicking
them in the Tracker when you have set <b>Becasso</b> to be the preferred
handler for their type.<p>

<i>Capture</i> is a new feature in version 1.1.  With it, you can
access special add-ons for various hardware (like scanners or digital
cameras) and capture still images from them.<p>

<i>Print Setup</i> opens the standard BeOS page setup dialog, which
can be used to setup various properties of the printer.<p>

<i>About Becasso</i> opens a window with information about the current
version of <b>Becasso</b> and two buttons that act as shortcuts
to viewing the present documentation, or <i>Sum Software</i>'s home
page, respectively.  <i>Quit</i> iterates over any open canvas windows,
checks whether their contents have been modified since the last save, asks
for an acknowledgement if so, and closes them.  After that, <b>Becasso</b>
will exit.

<a name="The Mode Selector"><h2>The Mode Selector</h2></a>

<img src="Images/modes.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="1" hspace="10">
The leftmost button in the main window is for selecting the current
mode of operation of <b>Becasso</b>.  One of the most apparent features of
<b>Becasso</b> is the orthogonality of the tool set, which means that any
tool can be used both for drawing and for selecting.  The drawing mode
is depicted by a pencil icon, the selection mode by a pointing hand
icon.  The Drawing Mode Attribute Window, which pops up on a right
click (or a Control-click) on the drawing mode icon, allows setting
the current drawing mode via a popup menu.  The drawing modes in this
popup are the standard BeOS drawing modes.
The <i>Tablet</i> popup can be used to select on which serial port an
optional Wacom tablet is connected.  <b>Becasso 1.1</b> offers limited
tablet support for some Wacom serial tablets (including erasing and
pressure sensitivity).<p>
Furthermore, the maximum
number of undo buffers can be adjusted.  <b>Note:</b> The memory usage of
<b>Becasso</b> is largely dependent on this setting.  It is recommended
you keep this number within reasonable accordance with the available
RAM/virtual memory on your machine.<br>
The Selection Mode does not have any options.<p>
You can quickly switch between Drawing and Selection mode when a <a
href="#The Canvas Window">canvas window</a> is active with the
<code>TAB</code> key.<p>

<a name="The Tool Selector"><h2>The Tool Selector</h2></a>

The second button is used to select the current tool.  For each of the
selected tools, the associated Attribute Window appears upon a right
click (or Control-click) on the button.<br>

In order of appearance, the tools are a Brush tool, an Eraser tool, a
Fill tool, a Text tool, a Spray Can tool, a Freehand tool, a Line
tool, a Free Shape tool, a Polygon tool, a Rectangle tool, an Oval
tool, a Circle tool, and an Ellipse tool.<p>

<i><b>The Brush Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/brushtool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
A Brush in <b>Becasso</b> is an 8 bit alpha map.  The Brush Attribute
Window allows adjustment of the brush dimensions and angle, as well as
the strength with which it will draw.
The Spacing slider
adjusts the spacing in pixels between adjacent applications of the brush
during a brush stroke.  In selection mode, you can use the brush to make
&quot;fuzzy&quot; selections.  When the drawing mode is set to Copy or
Over, the brush is alpha blended to the background image, in all the
other modes the corresponding BeOS drawing mode is used to draw the
brush as a greyscale bitmap in the selected foreground color.<p>

<i><b>The Eraser Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/erasertool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
With the eraser, you can reset parts of the canvas to the background.
When erasing the background layer itself (see the section on layers,
below), the result will be that the canvas will be completely transparent
at that place.  When there is no opacity, <b>Becasso</b> shows a light
grey / dark grey checkerboard pattern.  This is not an actual part of
the canvas.<br>

In the Eraser Attribute Window, the shape of the eraser can be
selected and its dimensions adjusted.<p>

<i><b>The Fill Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/filltool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
With this tool, you can change the color of an area of (approximately)
the same color to the selected pattern (see the Pattern Selector
section, below).  Clicking on a pixel will paint all adjacent pixels
of the same color (within an adjustable tolerance).  The Fill
Attribute Window allows adjustment of this tolerance, either by
directly specifying the maximum deviance of each of the Red, Green,
and Blue channels, or by specifying the maximum visual distance of the
pixels.  This visual distance takes into account the fact that the
human eye is not equally sensitive to every color, and weighs the
separate color channels accordingly.<br>
In selection mode, the fill tool doubles as a &quot;magic wand&quot;,
selecting all pixels of an area with (approximately) the same color.
The tolerance is reflected in the selection map, so that color nuances
are preserved.<p>

<i><b>The Text Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/texttool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
When the text tool is active, you can specify the place on the canvas
to add text by clicking.  This will open a text control at the
specified location on the canvas, into which you can type your text.
Closing with the Enter key, the text is painted onto the canvas.
Note: For best results, make sure the Drawing Mode is set to Over.
This will blend the text with the background.<br>
The Text Attribute Window allows selection of the font family and
style, as well as adjustment of the point size, shear, and rotation.
In selection mode, you can use this tool to make a selection in the
shape of the text.<p>

<i><b>The Spray Can Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/spraytool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
The Spray can deposits a steady flow of random pixels onto the canvas
via a Gaussian spread function.  The Spray Can Attribute Window allows
adjustment of the spread in pixel units, flow rate, and color ratio.
A color ratio of 0.0 only deposits pixels in the foreground color, a
ratio of 1.0 only background colored pixels.  Any value in between
&quot;mixes&quot; the colors.  The &quot;Fade with Distance&quot; checkbox
lets the pixels be lighter (less opaque) when farther away from the
cursor.  Operating the spray can tool with the right mouse button (or
via the Control key) inverts this ratio.<p>

<i><b>The Freehand Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/freehandtool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
This tool allows freehand drawing.  The Freehand Attribute Window has
only the single parameter of the pen size.  The pen uses the current
pattern, or its inverse when operated with the right mouse button (or
via the Control key).<p>

<i><b>The Lines Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/linestool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
There are two major paradigms on the user interface for specifying
lines on a canvas.  The first (&quot;click-drag-release&quot;) lets the
user fix the starting point of the line by clicking, and while the
user holds down the mouse button and drags the cursor, a
&quot;rubber&quot; line will stick to the mouse cursor, following the
movements of the user.  Releasing the mouse button will fix the end
point.<br>
The second (&quot;click-move-click&quot;) is less common because it is
thought to break the general mouse usage paradigm as used throughout
the OS, but it allows multiple-vertex lines by having the user fix the
vertices by clicking, while a &quot;rubber&quot; line follows the cursor
even when the mouse button is up.<p>
<b>Becasso</b> offers both paradigms and uses a simple algorithm to detect
which one the user is currently applying.  When the user moves the
mouse while the button is still down, <b>Becasso</b> will use the
click-drag-release paradigm, ending the line when the user releases
the mouse.  When the user releases the mouse on the same spot as where
the line was initiated, <b>Becasso</b> will switch to the click-move-click
paradigm.  Whenever the user presses the left mouse button, a line
segment from the previous vertex to the current cursor position will
be painted in the current pattern, or in the inverted pattern when a
vertex is fixed with the right mouse button (or via the Control key).
The user can end adding points by activating any other window (not
necessarily a <b>Becasso</b> window.<br>
The Line Attribute Window has a checkbox for determining whether
vertices should be filled to give a smooth line.  This is only of
significance with larger pen sizes.<p>

<i><b>The Shape Tools</b></i><br>
The following six tools are shape tools.  Their Attribute Windows all
have two general options in common, namely the pen size and the
general shape type.  This is one of: Shape filled with the current
pattern, with an outline in the current pen size and current
foreground color (or all these inverted when operated with the right
mouse button), shape filled with the current pattern, no outline, or an
outline only, painted with the current pen size and in the current
pattern.<p>

<i><b>The Free Shape Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/freeshapetool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
This tool allows the user to draw any shape on the canvas.  This tool
only uses the click-drag-release paradigm.  When the mouse button is
released, the shape is closed.<br>
In selection mode, this tool mimics a &quot;lasso selection
tool&quot;.<p>

<i><b>The Polygon Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/polygontool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
This tool uses the click-move-click paradigm to fix vertices of the
polygon.  The last point of the polygon is designated by using the
right mouse button (or the Control key).   More precisely, it is
designated by clicking with the other mouse button then was used to
fix the first vertex.  You can cancel the operation by activating any
other window (not necessarily a <b>Becasso</b> window).<p>

<i><b>The Rectangle Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/recttool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
The Rectangle tool (as well as the remaining three tools) can use both
the click-drag-release and the click-move-click paradigms to fix the
diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle.  In selection mode, this
tool is equivalent to the normal selection tool of conventional
graphic software without <b>Becasso</b>s orthogonality.<p>

<i><b>The Oval Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/ovaltool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
In this context, an oval is a rectangle with rounded corners.  The
radii of the corners can be set in the Oval Attribute Window, offering
the option of either fixed radii (the &quot;Absolute Corners&quot; radio
button; the number of pixels in x- and y-directions can be adjusted
with the corresponding sliders in the &quot;Absolute&quot; tab view) or
variable radii (the &quot;Relative Corners&quot; radio button; the ratio
of the radii to the total dimensions of the oval can be adjusted with
the corresponding sliders in the &quot;Relative&quot; tab view).<p>

<i><b>The Circle Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/circletool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
Circles can be painted on the canvas by either fixing the center of
the circle and moving the mouse outward to adjust the radius (again,
by either of the two paradigms) or by fixing a point on the perimeter
and having the center of the circle coincide with the mouse cursor.
Which of these methods is to be used can be selected from the Circles
Attribute Window.<p>

<i><b>The Ellipse Tool</b></i><br>
<img src="Images/ellipsetool.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
Either of the paradigms can be used to define the diagonally opposite
corners of a rectangle circumscribing the ellipse, i.e. defining a square 
yields a circle.<p><br>

<a name="The Color Selectors"><h2>The Color Selectors</h2></a>

The third and fourth button on the <b>Becasso</b> main window are used to
select the current foreground and background colors, respectively.
When a color selector is pressed with the left mouse button, a palette
pops up, containing 256 color entries.  Although the palette defaults
to the BeOS system palette, it is not limited to this and can in fact
contain any choice of colors.  The foreground and background color
selectors maintain separate palettes.<br>
Clicking on a color selector with the right mouse button (or with the
Control modifier key held down) will pop up an extensive <a href="#The
Color Editor">Color Editor</a> window.<br>
Note that in the current version, the palette popups are not dithered
on 8 bit screens.  With the default palette this is not noticeable
since the colors exactly match the 256 available colors in 8 bit
screens, but when a palette contains altered colors, this might not be
apparent from the popup.  The color selectors themselves are dithered
on 8 bit screens.<p>

<a name="The Pattern Selector"><h2>The Pattern Selector</h2></a>

The rightmost selector on the main window is for selection of the
current pattern.  In the present version of <b>Becasso</b>, there is no
Attribute Window for Patterns yet, but in a future version there will
be a pattern editor, allowing you to design your own patterns.
For most tools, operating them with the left mouse button will paint
in the current pattern, and operating them with the right mouse button
(or with the Control key) in the inverse of that pattern (i.e. with
the foreground and background colors switched around).  The top right
pattern is a solid low color, which is especially convenient in
combination with outlined, filled shape tools to draw shapes with a
solid background color and an outline in the foreground color.<p>
<a name="The Color Editor"><h3>The Color Editor</h3></a>

The Attribute Window of the color selectors contains an extensive
color editor, featuring both RGB and HSV models.  On 8 bit screens,
the color areas are dithered to most accurately represent the color
shades.<p>

<img src="Images/coloreditor.jpg" alt="" padding="2" align="right" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
<i><b>The File Menu</b></i><br>
Palettes can be saved and loaded.  The <b>Becasso</b> palette file format is
human readable.  You can also load palettes by dropping them on the
appropriate color selector button. or on the corresponding color
editor window.<br>
Furthermore, <b>Becasso</b> can generate palettes.<p>

<i><b>RGB Model</b></i><br>
In this model, the user can select which of the three color components
Red, Green, or Blue should be placed in the color column on the left
of the tab view, by selecting the corresponding radio button.  The
other two colors will span the 2D area to the right.  Clicking (or
dragging) the mouse inside either of these two color areas will ajdust
the corresponding color values.  You can also set the color components
directly by entering a value between 0 (no color) and 255 (full
intensity) into the corresponding text control.<p>

<i><b>HSV Model</b></i><br>
The Hue, Saturation, Value model for color selection uses a color
wheel on the right, in which the hue (0 - 360, as angle from the
horizontal) and the saturation (0 - 1, the distance from the center of
the wheel) can be selected, as well as an intensity selector on the
left, with which the Vaule (0 - 1) can be set.  You can also set the
components directly by entering the correct value in the corresponding
text control.<p>

<i><b>Alpha Channel</b></i><br>
The alpha channel determines the opacity of a color.  With the slider,
the alpha value can be adjusted from 0 (fully transparent) to 255
(fully opaque).  The setting of this slider determines the alpha value
of all subsequent color selections; you need not set the alpha value
for each of the colors in the palette.<p>

<i><b>Color Selection</b></i><br>
At the bottom part of the color editor, two color patches are visible.
The first shows the current color selection, the second the closest
match in the current palette, along with the visual distance between
them.  Pressing the &quot;Current&quot; button on the right (or pressing
Enter) will replace the currently selected color in the color selector
with the currently selected color in the color editor.  The &quot;Best
Match&quot; button tries to locate the closest match in the current
palette within a certain tolerance, and replaces that if it is found,
or the currently selected color if not.  The tolorance is expressed in
actual visual distance (see the explanation under the Fill Tool,
above), and can be adjusted with the &quot;Color Picker&quot; slider in
the color editor.  This tolerance is also used when picking colors
from the canvas (see Color Picking, below).<p>

<i><b>Color Drops</b></i><br>
<b>Becasso</b> is fully compatible with r&ouml;Designs r&ouml;Colour
drops.  You can use r&ouml;Colour to generate the correct color and
drop this on either of the Color Selector buttons in the
<b>Becasso</b> Main Window, or anywhere on the Color Editor
Window.<br>
Apart from <i>receiving</i> these color drops, <b>Becasso</b> also
<i>generates</i> them.  You can initiate a color drop by clicking on
either of the color patches in the lower left corner of the Color
Editor window, and dragging to the desired location.<p>


<a name="The Canvas Window"><h1>The Canvas Window</h1></a>

Opening an existing image on disk or a new canvas will open a Canvas
Window.  The title will show the file name (or &quot;Untitled
<i>n</i>&quot; in the case of a new canvas) and the current scale
factor in percentage.  The contents of the canvas are dithered on 8
bit screens to most closely match the actual colors. Note that this
happens in real time as you draw, and dragging the canvas window from
one workspace to another with a different bit depth will  cause the
dithering to automatically be adjusted.<br>
Left of the bottom scroll bar, the current mouse coordinates are shown.

<a name="Selections"><h2>Selections</h2></a>

Selections are shown by inverting the selected pixels whenever the
mouse is in the canvas view.  Selections can be of any shape, and you
can use any tool in selection mode to add areas to the selection.
Furthermore, a selection is actually an alpha map, allowing for
&quot;fuzzy&quot; selections as made with the brush tool.  You can copy
and paste selections between different windows of <b>Becasso</b>.  You can
also initiate a drag-and-drop sequence by holding the Shift key while
clicking on the canvas in selection mode.  Clicking the left mouse
button will copy the selection into the buffer, while the right mouse
button (or a Shift-Control-click) will also cut it from the canvas.
You can drag the selection around, during which it will be alpha
blended in real time, and drop it by releasing the mouse button.<p>
Note that you can quicky change between drawing and selection mode by
use of the <code>TAB</code> key shortcut.

<a name="Picking Colors"><h2>Picking Colors</h2></a>

During the operation of any tool, holding the Option key while
clicking somewhere on the canvas activates a Color Picker tool.
Clicking the left mouse button picks the foreground color, clicking
the right mouse button (or Control-Option-clicking) will select the
background color.  The color picker tool will look for the closest
match in the current palette of the selected color (foreground or
background) and replace that with the color under the mouse cursor if
it is within the tolerance (which can be adjusted in the corresponding
color editor window), or replace the currently selected color if it is
not.

<a name="The Canvas File Menu"><h2>The File Menu</h2></a>

The <i>File Menu</i> offers an extended subset of the <i>File</i> menu
in the Becasso main window.  Opening a file from this menu will open a
new canvas window with the contents of that file.<br> <i>Save</i> and
<i>Save As...</i> will save the current canvas image in <b>Becasso</b>s
own format, storing information about layers and settings as well.
<b>Becasso</b> also permits exporting the image to other formats via the
Datatypes library.  Selecting Export... from the menu will open a window
with all the formats for which you have Datatype handlers installed on
your system, from which you can pick which format to use.  Some formats
offer various settings; these can be adjusted in the bottom part of
the window.  When you click the &quot;Use&quot; button, a File Panel
will pop up, allowing you to select a file name as usual.
<i>Close</i> first checks whether the contents of the window were saved.
If not, the user is warned and given the choice to cancel the closing,
save the file, or discard any changes and abandon the file.  After this,
the window is closed.  The same can be effected by clicking on the closer
gadget in the window title.<br> 
<i>Quit</i> performs the same actions as <i>Close</i> on all windows of
<b>Becasso</b>. The same can be effected by selecting <i>Quit</i> from
the main window, or pressing its closer gadget.<p>

<a name="The Canvas Edit Menu"><h2>The Edit Menu</h2></a>

<b>Becasso</b> offers multiple undo/redo, which are accessible from
the <i>Edit</i> menu.  The maximum number of undo buffers can be selected 
from the Drawing Mode Attribute Window.<br>
The <i>Edit</i> menu also offers the usual range of cut, copy and
paste operations.  When a selection is drawn, the relevant menu options
are active.  <i>Select All</i> makes a selection of the entire canvas,
<i>Deselect All</i> clears the selection map.  <i>Invert Selection</i>
switches the selection map to its inverse.  The <i>Select by Color</i>
submenu allows for quickly making a selection map according to a given
color.  The <i>Automatic</i> option tries to guess what the background
color of the present image is, and selects according to it.  This can
be a valuable shortcut to select an image on a more-or-less
flat-colored background.<br>
<i>Colorize Selection</i> colors the canvas according to the selection
map.<br>
The <i>Channel to Selection</i> menu items will copy the given color
channel into the selection map, and <i>Selection to Channel</i> will
replace the given color channel with the current selection.<p>
More about selections and the various ways of generating and using them, 
below.<br>
The <i>Entire Canvas</i> submenu offers a number of operations that can
be performed on the canvas as a whole.  <i>Crop to Window</i> is active
(selectable) when the window is smaller than the canvas, and cuts off
any parts not visible.  <i>Crop to Selection</i> is active whenever
there is a selection, and crops the canvas to the minimal rectangle
circumscribing the selection.  <i>Autocrop</i> crops the canvas to
the smallest rectangle containing the picture.<br>
When the window is larger than the canvas, you can pad the canvas to the 
window size.  This &quot;adds canvas&quot; to the original canvas, thus 
enlarging it, without altering the original contents.<br> 
<i>Resize to Window</i> accomplishes the same by streching or shrinking
of the original canvas, offering the choice to keep the same ratio
between width and height as in the original (thus, probably, not filling
the entire window), or filling the entire window with the canvas, thus
altering the aspect ratio when needed.<br>
<i>Rotate</i> offers the possibility to rotate the entire canvas in 90 
degrees steps.<br>
<b><i>Note:</i></b> In the current version of <b>Becasso</b>, you
cannot undo operations that change the size of the canvas.<p>
The <i>Filter</i>, <i>Transform</i>, and <i>Generate</i> submenus offer 
access to add-on modules.<p>

<a name="Add-Ons"><h2>Add-Ons</h2></a>

<b>Becasso</b> does not have any filters built in, but instead uses BeOS'
advanced add-on capabilities to load separate modules at startup.  These are
placed in the <code>add-ons/</code> directory.<br>
<b>Becasso</b> discriminates three kinds of add-ons: <i>Filters</i>, 
<i>Transformers</i>, and <i>Generators</i>.
<b>Becasso</b> tries to extend the orthogonality principle to the
add-ons as well, in that add-ons take the current mode (either drawing
mode or selection mode) into account wherever this makes sense.  In
drawing mode, a given add-on operates on the selected part of the
canvas (or on the entire canvas if there is no selection).  In
selection mode, the add-on operates <i>on the selection map itself</i>.
This might seem strange at first (and cumbersome to have to switch
back to drawing mode after making a selection to apply the add-on to
the selected part of the canvas) but it allows for some extraordinary
effects.  For instance, generating a selection map with a gradient in
it and subsequently copy/pasting it makes blending of a selection with
the background very easy.<p>
Most add-ons have their own window, even if they don't have any
settings.  These windows show a progress bar, a &quot;Stop&quot;
button, an &quot;Info&quot; button, and an &quot;Apply&quot; button.
The progress bar in the add-on window is updated as the calculation
proceeds.  Lengthy calculations can be interrupted by clicking the
&quot;Stop&quot; button.  The canvas will then be left unmodified.<p>

Some add-ons can be operated interactively by &quot;direct
manipulation&quot; of the canvas (like the Gradient Generator), others 
&quot;block&quot; while they are active (like the Tile Generator).  A
blocking add-on provides feedback in the form of a modified cursor.<p>

Note to the add-on developers:  see the separate <a href="API.html">API 
documentation</a>.<p>

<i><b>Filters</b></i><br>
This class of add-ons comprises the effects most often found in other
image editing applications, like (Gaussian) blur filters, de-speckling
filters, color/contrast enhancing filters, etc.  Most of these filters
have a set of parameters controlling their operation on the canvas,
which are sometimes difficult to optimize for your particular desired
effect.  <b>Becasso</b> wouldn't be worthy of the BeOS if it would not 
offer <i>real time preview</i> of the effects of a given set of parameter 
settings.  Selecting a filter from the menu opens its parameter window
and simultaneously displays a small (64x64 pixel) rectangle on the
canvas, which is continuously updated with a preview of what the
filter does.  This preview area can be dragged across the canvas while
holding down the <code>ALT</code> (or <code>Command</code>) modifier
to inspect the effect of the current settings on any part of the
canvas.  It also reflects any changes you make to the parameters of the 
filter immediately.  When the effect is as desired, you can apply the
filter to the entire canvas (or its selected part if available) by
clicking the &quot;Apply&quot; button in the add-on window.<p>

<i><b>Transformers</b></i><br>
A <i>transformer</i> add-on modifies the canvas in a different kind.
Examples of <i>transformers</i> are add-ons that scale a selected part
of the canvas, rotate it, project it on a sphere, skew it, flip it,
etc.  Some of these (simple) transformations (like flipping) are not
interactive (nor would that make any sense) but others can be operated
in real time by dragging the mouse over the canvas.<p>
Since many transformations involve complex calculations, these may
offer a lower-quality &quot;preview&quot; mode while dragging (to keep
the process responsive).  When the transformation is as desired, 
releasing the mouse will render the transformation on the canvas in high 
quality.<p>

<i><b>Generators</b></i><br>
This class of add-ons generates an image.  It <i>may</i> use the
current contents of the canvas and generate a new image as a function
of it (e.g. to generate a selection of all pixels with an intensity 
above a given threshold, or all pixels of a given color) but it does
not need to.
<img src="Images/gradient.gif" alt="" padding="2" align="left" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
The image at the side, for instance, shows the
<i>Gradient Generator</i> in action.  First, a selection in the form
of a text was generated (simply by typing the text in selection mode),
after which <b>Becasso</b> was switched back to drawing mode.  Then,
the Gradient Generator add-on was opened by selecting it from the
<i>Edit</i> menu.  The Gradient Generator generates a color gradient
from the currently selected high color to the low color, offering a
variety of types of gradient (linear/circular, with different shapes
of the gradient &quot;ramp&quot;) and is operated by dragging
the mouse.  The white line visible in the canvas
shows the current direction of the gradient, which is updated in
real time as you drag.  Note that only the selected part of the canvas
(i.e. the text) is affected.  When the gradient is as desired, releasing
the mouse will render it (without the guide line of course) on the
canvas.<br> Note that the add-on &quot;remembers&quot; the position
of this guide line, so that you can generate a gradient with the same
characteristics, even on a new canvas and with different colors, by
clicking the &quot;Apply&quot; button on the Gradient Generator add-on
window.<p>

<a name="The Window Menu"><h2>The Window Menu</h2></a>

From the bottom up, the Window menu offers an item to resize the
window to fit the canvas (or fill the entire screen, whichever is
smallest), and a submenu to set the current magnification of the
canvas.  There are shortcuts for zooming in and out.  
Every tool wil work in any magnification.<br>
The <i>Layers</i> menu item opens the Layer Manager for the current
canvas.<p>

<a name="The Layer Menu"><h2>The Layer Menu</h2><a>
The layer menu offers shortcuts to some of the functionality of the
Layer Manager, so you don't have to keep that open while working, and
you can switch between layers with a simple keypress.

<a name="Layers"><h1>Layers</h1></a>

<img src="Images/layers.jpg" alt="" padding="2" align="right" 
border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">
<b>Becasso</b> uses the concept of <i>layers</i> in a canvas.  A layer
can best be thought of as a transparent sheet onto which you draw.
The opacity/transparency of the current colors can be adjusted with the
alpha channel slider in the color editor window.  When there are only
transparent pixels in a certain region of the canvas (for example when
you use the eraser on the background layer), <b>Becasso</b> will show these as a
light grey/dark grey checkerboard pattern.  This pattern is not part of
the actual image.  The first layer in a new canvas is somewhat special as
it is pre-filled with a white background color.  New layers will be fully
transparent upon creation.  The Layer Manager shows the current layer
layout of the canvas.  The layers are depicted with a thumbnail image
(which is updated in real time as you draw) and can be given a name by
double-clicking on it.  The currently active layer (which is modified
when you draw) is shown in  a darker grey.  You can add new layers
on top, insert new layers above the current layer, duplicate layers
(i.e. insert a copy of the current layer) or remove layers.  You can
select which layers to view by use of the &quot;Hide&quot; checkboxes in each
layer.  Layers can be re-arranged by dragging them to their new position.
Note that imported images from different formats often have their alpha
channel set to completely opaque, which means that any layer under such
an image will be hidden by it.  You can modify the &quot;global&quot; 
alpha level of an entire layer with the slider.  With the
&quot;Operation&quot; popup menu you can select the way layers should
be merged on top of each other.  <b>Becasso 1.1</b> offers <i>Blend</i>
and <i>Multiply</i>.  Blend mode simply superimposes the present layer
onto all layers beneath it, whereas in Multiply mode, each color
channel of each pixel is multiplied with the result so far.  This mode
can be used to &quot;filter&quot; certain colors.  For example, putting 
an all-red layer in multiply mode on top of an image filters out only 
the red components.<p>

When exporting a picture, it is exported exactly as shown on screen,
i.e. layers which have been hidden by selecting their &quot;Hide&quot;
buttons will also not be visible in the exported picture.<p>
