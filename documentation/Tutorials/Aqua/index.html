Aqua Text Effect (bumpmap tutorial)</font></b><p>

<font face="Swiss, Helvetica, Sans-serif">

This tutorial shows how you can make a quite good-looking text effect rather easily using
a single add-on and some selection tricks.<p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<img src="image1.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4">
Pick a suitable background image.  In the example we have simply used
the <b>Generate &gt; Tile</b> add-on to fill a blank new canvas with a cloud pattern,
although you could just as well have loaded an existing image.

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<img src="image2.jpg" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4">
Switch to selection mode and use the text tool to make type your text.
For this particular effect, a "round" font gives the best-looking results (we've used
VAG Rounded in the example).  Note that the bumpmap add-on (which we'll use later on to
create the effect) is by
no means limited to text selections, but its effect is easiest to demonstrate using text.

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<img src="image3.jpg" align="left" valign="top" vspace="4" hspace="4">
The bumpmap add-on uses the selection map as a "height map" and then "lights" the image under
an adjustable angle and elevation.  The selection as it stands after Step 2 changes quite "abruptly"
(apart from anti-aliasing effects) so using it as a bumpmap directly would result in very
"sharp" transitions.  To change this, we use the Gaussian Blur add-on to make the selection map more
"fuzzy".  So after this step, the selection (to be used as a bump map) can be thought of as having
the "steep steps" smoothed out into gradual slopes.

<h3>Step 4</h3>

Switching back to Drawing mode and fiddling with the various parameters of the
bumpmap add-on yields the end result.  The "Angle" and "Elevation" sliders in the add-on
are for positioning the position of the virtual light source; the "Specular" slider can be
thought of as controlling the type of "material" the canvas is made of - a matte material
(such as paper) has almost no specular reflection properties, whereas a "shiny" material (such as
glass or plastic) has a high specular reflection.  The particular "translucent" effect is
achieved by setting the "Translucent" slider to a nonzero value, and setting the light
color to light cyan.<br clear="all"><br><br>
