Hello Scott,

I agree with putting the Becasso source code under MIT license.  I wish I
had more time to work on interesting projects such as Haiku myself, but
alas=85 :-(

Regards,
Sander

Sander,
I have attached the Translators code to this Haiku trac ticket:
https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/1244
I've held off on posting the BeCasso code publicly yet, since I don't know
how to handle the license issue.  With the Translators code I don't see
anyone wanting to port that to another OS since it is so tied to the way
BeOS/Haiku work, so I figure releasing that under MIT won't see you
competing against yourself.  Although even if your old BeCasso code were
released under MIT, sure someone could port it to MacOS but you already
know that code and how to do it better so you'd already have an advantage
competing against your old self... ;)
Anyways we've started collecting a lot of old BeOS source code on GitHub:
https://github.com/HaikuArchives/
So far we've moved 82 projects there under  "HaikuArchives"

Haiku will be adding package management any day now which will be a huge
step forward for the OS and gets us one step closer to R1.

Anyways if releasing under MIT would be ok for BeCasso just let me know and
I'll move it forward.
