Becasso 1.3 Release Notes

Below is a list of features new in version 1.3.

Becasso 2.0 will be an Adamation product, as announced at the March '98 Be Developer Conference.  However, this 1.2 version is not an Adamation product!  Please direct all support questions to becasso@sumware.demon.nl and not to Adamation.

Also included in this distribution are PNG, JPEG, and Becasso Translators.  Note that all of these use shared libraries and will only function from within other applications when these are in the correct place (~/config/lib).  The BeOS comes with a JPEG translator, but that one doesn't use shared libraries, is statically linked to a less recent JPEG library, and offers less adjustable parameters.
